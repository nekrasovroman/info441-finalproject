## Project Description

### Who is your target audience? Who do you envision using your application?

The target audience for this application is sales teams that operate within a shared organization, specifically salespeople and sales managers who manage business relationships tied to physical locations. We envision users who work in geographically defined territories and need a simple way to organize and manage businesses they interact with. Salespeople use the application to track the businesses they personally manage, while sales managers use it to view and manage all businesses associated with their organization. Both roles interact with the same core interface, but with different levels of access based on responsibility.

### Why does your audience want to use your application?

The audience wants to use this application because it provides a clear and intuitive way to organize business data around real-world locations rather than abstract lists. By representing businesses as pins on a map, users can visually understand where their accounts / sales  leads are located and easily access related information. The application allows users to create businesses, attach contacts, tasks, and activity records, and maintain structured data within a shared organization. Role-based access ensures that salespeople can manage only their own leads, while managers can oversee and edit all businesses within the organization. This structure supports accountability, prevents duplicated work, and keeps data organized in a way that aligns with how teams actually operate.

### Why do you as developers want to build this application?

We want to build this application because it provides a strong opportunity to design and implement a complete server-side system with realistic constraints. One of our members has worked in sales and wishes software like this existed. The project allows us to work with user authentication, role-based authorization, relational data modeling, and persistent storage while keeping the user interface intentionally simple. By focusing on accounts, users, permissions, and structured data relationships, we can demonstrate a solid understanding of server-side development concepts and how they support real-world applications.
